# BayesClassifier
This program creates a website where a user has a quiz in the beginning and based on 
the answers from the quiz creates a new table and computes the probabilities that the 
user will like the dress that is stored in different table. It uses naive bayes classifier
in computing the probabilities and it will reorder the table based on the probabilities. 
The website will display the top dress from the table, two from the middle and two from the 
bottom. The user will be able to say if she likes the dresses. Those answers will be added 
to the table and the probabilities will be computed again using the same process. At the last 
page the dress with the highest probability will be displayed.
